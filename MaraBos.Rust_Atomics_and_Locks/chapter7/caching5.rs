/*
Because A is always zero, this compare_exchange operation will never succeed. Itâ€™ll load the current value of A, but never update it to a new value.

One might reasonably expect this to behave the same as a load operation, since it does not modify the atomic variable. However, on most processor architectures, the instruction(s) of compare_exchange will claim exclusive access of the relevant cache line regardless of whether the comparison succeeds or not.

This means that it can be beneficial to not use compare_exchange (or swap) in a spin loop like we did for our SpinLock in Chapter 4, but instead use a load operation first to check if the lock has been unlocked. That way, we avoid unnecessarily claiming exclusive access to the relevant cache line.
